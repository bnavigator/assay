-----

This prototype testing framework was designed to do everything right
that I thought other Python testing frameworks did poorly. But I have
never had the chance to finish it, so I took the opportunity when
speaking at the Puget Sound Programming Python meetup to give a talk
about my vision of how a testing framework would operate:

To try out this code, either check out the repository and install it
directly from your clone:

    git clone https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/assay.git
    cd assay
    pip install -e .

Or you can, without creating your own clone of the repository, install
it directly from GitHub:

    pip install https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/assay/archive/master.zip
